What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it adds a hidden git file to the specified 
directory that tracks metadata on the directory. You do it in order to run 
all of the git commands you need to handle version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place in between the working directory and the 
repository. It's where you put the files from the working directory that are
ready to go to the repository. The main value it offers is that it provides an
area to put only the pieces of the working directory that you'd like to 
commit, rather than making you commit everything from the working directory.
It's sort of just a logical separator in my mind.
